### Notes for the HSAS version
This version is just made for fun. We HIGHLY respect all the teachers. The order of teachers is arranged solely according to the official website of the school, without any personal subjective intention. There is no improper guidance. Students should respect and honor their teachers. You can [fork the original repo as well](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048)

## Donations
Gabriele made this in his spare time, and it's hosted on GitHub (which means I don't have any hosting costs), but if you enjoyed the game and feel like buying him coffee, you can donate at his BTC address: `1Ec6onfsQmoP9kkL3zkpB6c5sA4PVcXU2i`.
